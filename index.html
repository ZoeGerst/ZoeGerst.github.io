        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Oregon State
            University, where my passion for technology and creativity merged seamlessly. With a keen interest in video
            game development, computer animation, 2D animation, and computer graphics, I am driven by the endless
            possibilities technology offers in shaping immersive digital experiences. Proficient in languages such as C,
            C++, Python, Rust, HTML, and OpenGL, I strive to push the boundaries of innovation in my projects. 
            Beyond the realm of coding, I am adept in Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and Animate, leveraging these tools 
            to bring my creative visions to life.</p>

        <p>Outside of the tech
            sphere, I hold significant achievements including a Second Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do and Hop Kido. 
            My favorite TV show is Gravity Falls. One of my favorite hobbies include baking. I love hanging out with my friends in my spare time.  
            Passionate, versatile, and driven, I am committed to exploring new horizons in the ever-evolving landscape 
            of technology and design.</p>

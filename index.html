        <p>Welcome to my personal website! I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Oregon State
            University, where my passion for technology and creativity merged seamlessly. With a keen interest in video
            game development, computer animation, 2D animation, and computer graphics, I am driven by the endless
            possibilities technology offers in shaping immersive digital experiences. Proficient in languages such as C,
            C++, Python, Rust, HTML, and OpenGL, I strive to push the boundaries of innovation in my projects. My
            internship at Cantu Graphics in South Pasadena, CA, provided me with valuable industry experience, further
            honing my skills and expanding my knowledge base. Beyond the realm of coding, I am adept in Adobe Photoshop,
            Illustrator, and Animate, leveraging these tools to bring my creative visions to life. Outside of the tech
            sphere, I hold significant achievements including a Second Degree Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do and Hop Kido, as
            well as participation in the Student Ambassador program in Australia. Passionate, versatile, and driven, I
            am committed to exploring new horizons in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and design.</p>
